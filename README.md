# Social Network Analysis of Murder on the Orient Express: A Graph-Based Exploration of Character Relationships

## Project Goals
- Character Network Creation
The core of the project involves creating a social graph where nodes represent the characters, and edges represent interactions or relationships between them. The strength and frequency of these relationships will drive the analysis.
- Network Analysis:
The graph will then undergo various analyses to measure important network properties such as centrality (which characters are most important), clustering (how tightly connected characters are), community detection (grouping characters), and other network metrics.
- Comparison with Generative Models:
By comparing the extracted social graph with theoretical network models, the project aims to explore how well the structure of the story matches typical patterns found in real-world or simulated social networks.
